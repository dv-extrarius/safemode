# SafeMode
This datapack practically makes you invulnerable, but each part can be toggled off to allow different kinds of danger. By default, it instantly heals all damage (and makes you extremely resistant to damage), gives you slow fall, water breathing, invisibility, and refills food (which refills health). For each of these, there is a trigger you can execute. You can also /trigger smHelp to get a display of what the current settings are and clicking on a setting will toggle it.

Effect | Trigger Command
------ | ---------------
Refill Health (& Damage Resistance) | /trigger smHealth
Refill Food | /trigger smFood
Slow Fall | /trigger smSlowFall
Invisibility | /trigger smInvisibility
Water Breathing | /trigger smWaterBreathing
